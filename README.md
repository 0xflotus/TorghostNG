# Notes before you use Tor
Tor can't help you completely anonymous, just almost:

* [Is Tor Broken? How the NSA Is Working to De-Anonymize You When Browsing the Deep Web](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/is-tor-broken-nsa-is-working-de-anonymize-you-when-browsing-deep-web-0148933)
* [Use Traffic Analysis to Defeat TOR](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/use-traffic-analysis-defeat-tor-0149100)
* ...

It's recommended that you should use [NoScript](https://noscript.net) before before surfing the web with Tor. NoScript shall block JavaScript/Java/Flash scripts on websites to make sure they won't reveal your real identify.

# And please
* **Don't spam or perform DoS attacks with Tor.** It's not effective, you will only make Tor get hated and waste Tor's money.
* **Don't torrent over Tor.** If you want to keep anonymous while torrenting, use a no-logs VPN please.
